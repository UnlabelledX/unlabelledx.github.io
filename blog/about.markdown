What does unlabelled*X* mean you ask? It’s a cheeky name actually suggested to me by chatGPT ([clearly coincidental though](https://x.com/svpino/status/1844765535457902839)). 

In supervised machine learning, we always need “labels” to help the models learn. Unfortunately for me, right from the onset of my first serious ML gig, all the problems I worked on didn't have any labels for training, either because labelling was difficult or expensive. Quite a bummer for a youngster looking to get his teeth wet in an interesting field like machine learning only to realise learning can't be done. That's where I saw opportunity and ever since have only worked on problems where there no labels hence Unlabelled. 

So what is *X* now? *X* is a notation in ML denoting input or feature data to an ML model while *y* is referred to the “labels” for the corresponding input which we don’t have. There you have it Unlabelled*X*
